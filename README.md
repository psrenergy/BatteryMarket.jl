## Getting Started

### Install
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/psrenergy/BatteryMarket.jl
```

### Using
The basic file structure to use this project is as follows:
```
|__ folder
    |__ battery.toml
    |__ model.toml
    |__ data.csv
```

`.toml` files can be ignored by writing an underscore `_` before the file name as in `"_battery.toml"` and `"_model.toml"`.
To run a simulation based on `data.csv` and the configuration files one must do:
```julia
julia> import BatteryMarket

julia> BatteryMarket.simulate(basepath="path/to/folder")
```
or via the command-line interface:
```bash
$ julia -e 'import BatteryMarket; BatteryMarket.simulate(basepath="path/to/folder")'
```
if `basepath` is not provided, defaults to the current directory (`pwd()`).

this will produce the `"results.csv"` file:
```
|__ folder
    |__ battery.toml
    |__ model.toml
    |__ data.csv
    |__ results.csv
```

### `model.toml`
```toml
[Model]
model_type = "base"
    
[Model.Window]
num_windows   = 365
window_size   = 24  # hours
forecast_size = 24  # hours
```

The `model_type` key must be either the `"base"` or `"connected"`. The `[Model.Window]` block introduces the Rolling Window Model, where `num_windows`, `window_size` and `forecast_size` must be set.

### `battery.toml`
```toml
[[Battery]]
code = 32
charge_eff = 0.9
discharge_eff = 0.98
max_storage = 20.6
max_charge = 2.1
max_discharge = 1.9
initial_charge = 0.0

[[Battery]]
code = 33
charge_eff = 0.92
discharge_eff = 0.96
max_storage = 16.1
max_charge = 3.2
max_discharge = 2.8
initial_charge = 0.0
```

### `data.csv`
The `"base"` model requires the price (`"p"`) column to be present and the `"connected"` one requires both price and available energy (`"E"`) columns.
